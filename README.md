# Duolingo-Progress

Keeping track of my progress on Duolingo.

About the `.keep` files: **git** doesn't commit empty folders, so when I want an empty folder to be commited to **GitHub** I add an empty file to the folder.

As 2021-12-04 'points_rank' was no longer available from Duolingo API. Had to remove all references to 'points_rank' from code. The package `duolingo-api` from **pypi** also no longer worked, so downloaded the code from [Github](https://github.com/KartikTalwar/Duolingo). Renamed the file `duolingo.py` to `duolingoapi.py`, removed references to 'points_rank' and included it in my repository (for now).
